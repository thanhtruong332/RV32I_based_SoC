# Reproducibility evidence — RV32I_based_SoC

This directory is the compact reviewer-facing evidence package for release `v1.2.2`.
The Git commit is the commit referenced by the annotated release tag; resolve it with
`git rev-parse v1.2.2^{commit}`.

| Requested item | Location / status |
| --- | --- |
| RTL commit hash | Annotated tag `v1.2.2` |
| Firmware hash | `SHA256SUMS.txt` covers `firmware/images/` and `firmware/source/` |
| Vivado version | `metadata.json`; confirmed by the report headers |
| Tcl scripts | `scripts/` plus the project scripts at `../scripts/` |
| XDC | `../constraints/zedboard.xdc` |
| Compiler version / flags | Not applicable to the handwritten assembly snapshot; assembler version was not recorded |
| Linker script / ELF / map | Not available for this handwritten hardware-offload firmware snapshot |
| Raw counters | `raw_counters/` |
| SAIF/VCD | `activity/RV32I_CTR_4KiB_postroute.saif` (SAIF was the power input; no equivalent VCD was generated) |
| Power / timing / utilization | `reports/` |
| Seed scripts and run definition | `scripts/run_multirun_timing.tcl`, `scripts/query_seed_params.tcl`, and `seed/` |
| Expected NIST vectors | `expected/nist_sp_800_38a_vectors.csv` and the full payload vectors at `../expected/` |

The raw Vivado report headers retain the original workstation paths as provenance.
The Tcl files in this directory use arguments instead of those historical absolute paths.
